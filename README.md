<h1>Getting Started</h1>
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game should be playable on any modern web browser.

<h3>How to Play (base settings)</h3>
On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided dice. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they score no points for that turn. If the player rolls a number other than 1, the number is added to their turn score. The player can then choose to either end their turn and add their turn score to their total score, or they can choose to roll the die again to try to increase their turn score.

If a player reaches a score of 100 or more at the end of their turn, they win the game.
